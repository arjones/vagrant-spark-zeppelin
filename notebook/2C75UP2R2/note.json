It answers those two points with __efficient data sharing__ accross computations.\n\u003chr/\u003e\nThe past years have seen a major changes in computing systems, as growing data volumes required more and more applications to scale out to large clusters. To solve this problem, a wide range of new programming models have been designed to manage multiple types of computations in a distributed fashion, without having people learn too much about distributed systems. Those programming models would need to deal with _parallelism, fault-tolerance and resource sharing_ for us.\n\n[Google\u0027s MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) presented a simple and general model for batch processing, which handles faults and parallelism easily. Unfortunately the programming model is not adapted for other types of workloads, and multiple specialized systems were born to answer a specific need in a distributed way. \n* Iterative : Giraph\n* Interactive : Impala, Piccolo, Greenplum\n* Streaming : Storm, Millwheel\n\n#\nThe initial goal of Apache Spark is to try and unify all of the workloads for generality purposes. [Matei Zaharia](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/) in his [PhD dissertation](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-12.pdf) suggests that most of the data flow models that required a specialized system needed _efficient data sharing_ accross computations:\n* Iterative algorithms like PageRank or K-Means need to make multiple passes over the same dataset\n* Interactive data mining often requires running multiple ad-hoc queries on the same subset of data\n* Streaming applications need to maintain and share state over time.\n\nHe then proposes to create a new abstraction that gives its users direct control over data sharing, something that other specialized systems would have built-in for their specific needs. The abstraction is implemented inside a new engine that is today called Apache Spark. The engine makes it possible to support more types of computations than with the original MapReduce in a more efficient way, including interactive queries and stream processing. ",

Under the hood, Spark automatically performs the distribution of RDDs and its processing around the cluster, so we can focus on our code and not on distributed processing problems, such as the handling of data locality or resiliency in case of node failure.\n\nA RDD consists of a collection of elements partitioned accross the nodes of a cluster of machines that can be operated on in parallel. In Spark, work is expressed by the creation and transformation of RDDs using Spark operators.\n\n\u003ctext style\u003d\"color:red;\"\u003eNote\u003c/text\u003e : RDD is the core data structure to Spark, but the style of programming we are studying in this lesson is considered the _lowest-level API_ for Spark. The Spark community is pushing the use of Structured programming with Dataframes/Datasets instead, an optimized interface for working with structured and semi-structured data, which we will learn later. Understanding RDDs is still important because it teaches you how Spark works under the hood and will serve you to understand and optimize your application when deployed into production.\n\nThis example displays the coarse-grained processing nature of Spark, that applies the same operation to many data items. This is a good fit for many parallel applications, as they _naturally apply the same operation to multiple data items_.",

Under the hood, Spark automatically performs the distribution of RDDs and its processing around the cluster, so we can focus on our code and not on distributed processing problems, such as the handling of data locality or resiliency in case of node failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA RDD consists of a collection of elements partitioned accross the nodes of a cluster of machines that can be operated on in parallel. In Spark, work is expressed by the creation and transformation of RDDs using Spark operators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ctext style\u003d\"color:red;\"\u003eNote\u003c/text\u003e : RDD is the core data structure to Spark, but the style of programming we are studying in this lesson is considered the \u003cem\u003elowest-level API\u003c/em\u003e for Spark. The Spark community is pushing the use of Structured programming with Dataframes/Datasets instead, an optimized interface for working with structured and semi-structured data, which we will learn later. Understanding RDDs is still important because it teaches you how Spark works under the hood and will serve you to understand and optimize your application when deployed into production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis example displays the coarse-grained processing nature of Spark, that applies the same operation to many data items. This is a good fit for many parallel applications, as they \u003cem\u003enaturally apply the same operation to multiple data items\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
